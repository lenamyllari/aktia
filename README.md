# aktia
React, Maven, SpringBoot, Lombok, H2... 


This is far from perfect, but the best I could do in a short time with one hand while doing school projects and taking care of the children with the another one.

To make your job easier:<br>
1. <br>
![no tests meme](https://i.imgflip.com/1o8gaf.jpg)
<br> 
No tests, so they don't fail<br> 

2. No comments. <br> <br>

3. No editing of services in frontend (but you can add them to agreements).<br> 

4. I get the sums of the fees into console, but not to the table, yeee: partly working is already working, isn't it?<br> 

5. The client side needs some coffee as we all do: sometimes you need to force it to update to see the right data. <br>

6. From the client side you can see that I'm not into frontend designing, <br> 
although I enjoy art and make good photos, so I should understand something about beauty and style, but somehow it doesn't work.<br>  

7. I was quite confident in the beginning, so I took Spring Boot and Lombok, which I haven't tried before, so plenty of time was spent while studying and trying them. <br> 

8. You propably know all this better than me. but it's a README file, so this is supposed to be here:<br> 
to start the server:<br> 
<strong>./mvnw spring-boot:run</strong> in <strong>aktia/aktia_backend</strong> folder<br>
to start the frontend:<br>
<strong>npm start</strong> in <strong>aktia.frontend</strong> folder
